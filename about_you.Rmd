## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?  
 

### my answer     
  I am taking statistics because I made the mistake of taking Math 115. I took math 115 because I was under the false impression that it was a transferable class.
